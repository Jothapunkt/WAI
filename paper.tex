\begin{abstract}
Hash Tables are a very widely used data structure that maps keys to values. Using a hash function to compute indices allows them to complete operations very quickly. Balanced Binary Search Trees are trees with branches that are close to equal length, keeping their height to a minimum. Since the cost of most tree operations scales with the trees height, this is very time effective. This paper is dedicated to comparing the perfomance of both data structures. Less experienced programmers might not have any insight into the inner workings of the data structures they are relying on, or where the strengths of the individual structures lie. We performed benchmarks to measure how long it takes to retrieve values depending on the collection size. We also measured how long it takes to retrieve multiple sequential values. These benchmarks showed us that the Hash Table performance is not heavily impacted by the collection size, making it ideal for large collection sized.  The Search Tree was slower when retrieving single entries, but outperformed the Hash Table when multiple sequential values had to be found.
