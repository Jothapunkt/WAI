When performing our benchmarks\footnote{All benchmarks were run on a computer using an Intel Core i5 M520 processor running at 2.4 GHZ base clock and 8GB RAM}, we use both Integer keys and values. We first fill the data structure we are benchmarking with a set number of key-value-pairs, measuring the time needed from the first entry to the last. Then we perform a number of lookups, using randomized keys, again measuring the time from start to finish.\\ 
We also include a measurement where we retrieve a number of sequential keys, as you would when using a map like an Array or linked list.  For the benchmarks, we evaluate different combinations of collection size, neighbor count and query count. 
All code used was written in Java\footnote{Code can be viewed here: https://github.com/Jothapunkt/WAI/tree/master/src}. For Hash Tables, we used the HashMap from Javas standard library. For Search Trees, we used an altered Version of an implementation provided by the Princeton University\footnote{Original Version can be found here: https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/edu/princeton/cs/algs4/BTree.java.html}.
